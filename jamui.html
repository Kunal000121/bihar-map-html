                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <strong>Jamui</strong> a town and a municipality in Jamui district in the Indian state of Bihar.
                It is the district headquarter of Jamui district. Jamui was formed as a district on 21
                February 1991 as a result of its separation from Munger. It is part of Munger Division.
                The town is situated about 60km South-West of Munger.<br /><br />

                Historical existence of Jamui has been observed from the
                period of Mahabharta war. Archaeological and historical evidence shows its close association
                with the Jain tradition for a long past to the present time. A large part of this area is covered by
                forest.<br /><br />

                There are mainly two hypotheses which have been mentioned by historians regarding the origin of
                the name of the district Jamui. The first hypothesis said that the name of Jamui derived from
                "Jambhiya Gram" or "Jribhikgram" village, which has the place of attaining ‘Omniscience’ (<strong>Kevala
                    Jnana</strong>)
                of Vardhaman Mahavira and according to another hypothesis the name Jamui is originated from Jambuwani.

                <h2>Geography</h2>
                Jamui is located at 24.92°N 86.22°E.[2] It has an average elevation of 78
                metres (255 feet).<br />

                Jamui is located in a transitional zone between the vast,
                fertile Gangetic plain to the north and the hilly margins of
                the Chota Nagpur plateau to the south. The Kiul River, which flows by Jamui's
                east side, has its headwaters in this upland region. During the monsoon rains, the
                Kiul can become very powerful and turbulent, and in 1949 it flooded and destroyed the
                bridge northeast of Jamui.[3]: 210 [4]: 479–80 <br /><br />

                Jamui is well connected to the rest of the country via road while the Delhi-Howrah rail
                line is 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) away at Mallepur (Malaypur railway station is also known as
                Jamui railway station). Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Airport in Patna is about 161 kilometres
                (100 mi) and Gaya Airport 136 kilometres (85 mi) away.<br /><br />

                Situated along the Bihar-Jharkhand border, Jamui is dotted with hills and the small
                retreat town of Simultala falls within the Jhajha block, on the main Delhi-Howrah
                rail line. The town of Gidhaur, situated 17 kilometres (11 mi) away was the seat
                of kings during the British Raj and many buildings from the period still survive.
                Minto Tower in Gidhaur is a prime example of architecture from the period. Jamui
                district is also known for having many places related to the origin of Jainism.<br /><br />

                The district has untapped reserves of resources including mica, coal, gold and iron ore.</div>
